 * exceptions; self-distributed XPIs get a random per-install UUID).

 * are still per-origin scoped, so this is not a CSRF vector.
 *
 * The `http://api.epicenter.so` entry is for `wrangler dev`, which serves
 * the custom domain over plain HTTP. In production Cloudflare upgrades the
 * domain to HTTPS, so this Origin is never sent by a real browser there.
