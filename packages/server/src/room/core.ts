/**
 * Runtime-agnostic Yjs sync + dispatch room.
 *
 * Owns: the Yjs document, the connection set, server-owned presence, and
 * the dispatch correlation table. Does NOT own the WebSocket lifecycle
 * (fetch/upgrade/`webSocketMessage` callbacks), the alarm scheduling, or
 * the update-log storage; those are backend-specific and live in the
 * adapter.
 *
 * Imports no `cloudflare:workers` symbols. Both Cloudflare's Durable
 * Object and a future Bun backend drive the same {@link createRoomCore}
 * instance through the methods listed on its return object.
 *
 * ## Wire surfaces
 *
 * Two wire surfaces share one authenticated socket but are independent at
 * the protocol level:
 *
 *   binary WS frames  -> standard y-protocols SYNC.
 *   text WS frames    -> live-device dispatch and the server-owned
 *                        presence channel (`presence`).
 *
 * Dispatch is relay-mediated and rides text frames: a caller's
 * `dispatch_request` is routed to the recipient as `dispatch_inbound`;
 * the recipient's `dispatch_response` is routed back to the caller as
 * `dispatch_result`, correlated by a caller-minted `id`.
 *
 * ## Presence
 *
 * Presence is server-owned: the `connections` map is the source of truth.
 * On every connection change a `presence` text frame is broadcast carrying
 * the FULL client list (computed per-recipient, self excluded), so clients
 * store the list verbatim with no delta reassembly.
 *
 * ## Adapter contract
 *
 * Backends drive `RoomCore` through six entry points:
 *
 *   - `addConnection(socket, connection)`     on accept
 *   - `removeConnection(socket, code)`         on close
 *   - `handleMessage(socket, message)`         on inbound frame
 *   - `sync(body)` / `getDoc()`                for HTTP RPC
 *   - `compact()`                              after idle
 *
 * `connectionCount` is exposed as a query so the backend can schedule
 * deferred compaction when the room empties.
