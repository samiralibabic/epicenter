/**
 * Cloudflare Durable Object adapter for {@link createRoomCore}.
 *
 * The `DurableObject` base class is the one place a class is unavoidable:
 * Cloudflare's runtime instantiates it per room and routes the
 * Hibernation API callbacks (`webSocketMessage`, `webSocketClose`,
 * `webSocketError`, `alarm`) to method overrides. This class is a thin
 * shell: every callback forwards to a single {@link RoomCore} instance
 * built in the constructor.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * 1. **Constructor**: `blockConcurrencyWhile` runs a synchronous init
 *    that builds the {@link RoomUpdateLog} over `ctx.storage`, creates
 *    the `RoomCore`, and re-registers any sockets that survived
 *    hibernation via `ctx.getWebSockets()`.
 * 2. **`fetch`**: only handles WebSocket upgrades; HTTP sync goes via
 *    RPC (`stub.sync()`, `stub.getDoc()`).
 * 3. **Hibernation callbacks**: forward to `core` directly.
 * 4. **`alarm`**: deferred compaction 30 s after the room empties.
 *
 * ## RoomSocket compatibility
 *
 * Cloudflare's hibernation `WebSocket` exposes `send`, `close`, and
 * `readyState`. TypeScript's structural typing treats it as a
 * {@link RoomSocket}, so the raw socket is passed straight to
 * `core.addConnection` / `core.handleMessage` / `core.removeConnection`
 * with no wrapper.

 *
 * Owns the Hibernation API integration (`acceptWebSocket`,
 * `serializeAttachment`, `setAlarm`) and forwards every meaningful event
 * to the {@link RoomCore} instance built in the constructor.
 *
 * ## Worker to DO interface
 *
 * - **RPC** (`stub.sync()`, `stub.getDoc()`): for HTTP sync and snapshot
 *   bootstrap. Direct method calls avoid Request/Response serialization
 *   overhead for binary payloads.
 * - **fetch** (`stub.fetch(request)`): for WebSocket upgrades only;
 *   the 101 Switching Protocols handshake requires HTTP semantics.
 *
 * ## Auth & data isolation
 *
 * Handled upstream by Hono routes in `@epicenter/server`. The Worker
 * validates the caller, checks any route-owned policy, and builds the
 * internal DO name before calling RPC methods or forwarding `fetch`. The
 * DO itself does not re-validate. DO names are host-owned opaque strings
 * built by `doName(ownerId, roomId)`, producing `owners/<ownerId>/rooms/<roomId>`
 * in both modes (in personal mode `ownerId === user.id`, in team mode
 * `ownerId === 'team'`).

	 * 2. **Synchronous async callback**: The callback passed to
	 *    `blockConcurrencyWhile` contains no `await`, so it executes to
