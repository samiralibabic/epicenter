/**
 * attachEncryption: per-ydoc encryption coordinator.
 *
 * A workspace owns several `EncryptedYKeyValueLww` stores (one per table plus
 * the KV store). This attachment derives a per-workspace HKDF keyring at
 * attach time and calls `activateEncryption(keyring)` on each store before
 * the caller gets it back. Call the methods on the returned attachment to
 * register encrypted resources:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const encryption = attachEncryption(ydoc, { keyring: () => ownerKeyring });
 * const tables = encryption.attachTables(defs);
 * const kv = encryption.attachKv(defs);
 * ```
 *
 * The method names mirror the plaintext primitives (`attachTable`,
 * `attachTables`, `attachKv`) so the pattern reads symmetrically:
 * "encryption's attach-tables" vs "plain attach-tables."
 *
 * ## Key source: lazy callback
 *
 * `keyring` is a callback into whoever owns identity. The coordinator calls
 * it synchronously at every `attachTable` / `attachKv` site, derives the
 * per-workspace keyring, and activates the store. The keyring is not cached
 * on the attachment: each attach call is its own derivation, which keeps
 * state out of this layer entirely.
 *
 * Same-owner identity updates (key rotation, profile edits) do not flow
 * through this attachment. Authenticated apps reload the page on
 * different-owner transitions; same-owner updates are observed lazily
 * via the `keyring` callback the next time it runs.
 *
 * ## Local persistence concerns live elsewhere
 *
 * Encrypted IndexedDB persistence and owner-scoped BroadcastChannel are
 * owner-scoped (one `(server, ownerId)` pair) rather than ydoc-scoped, so they
 * live on `attachLocalStorage(ydoc, { server, ownerId, keyring })`. Local-data
 * wipe lives on `wipeLocalStorage({ server, ownerId })`. Both are free
 * functions in this package; callers compose them around `attachEncryption`
 * at use sites.
 *
 * ## Disposal
 *
 * Each attached store hooks `ydoc.once('destroy', ...)` at attach time,
 * mirroring the plaintext `attachTable` / `attachKv` primitives. Callers tear
 * down encryption by calling `ydoc.destroy()`: the attachment does not expose
 * a standalone `dispose()` method.
 *
 * ## What this attachment does NOT do
 *
 * - It does not wipe local storage. `wipeLocalStorage({ server, ownerId })` owns that.
 * - It does not validate that every encryption-capable slot on the Y.Doc got
 *   registered. The caller owns the composition: if you pair a plaintext
 *   `attachTable` with `encryption.attachTable` targeting the *same slot
 *   name*, Yjs hands both calls the same underlying `Y.Array` and you get a
 *   silent plaintext-over-ciphertext race. The verb (`encryption.attachTable`
 *   vs plain `attachTable`) is the primary defense; review call sites
 *   accordingly. One slot name, one attach site, one intent.
 *
 * ## Why `workspaceId` is read from `ydoc.guid`
 *
 * By construction, the workspace Y.Doc's `guid` equals the workspace id
 * (`new Y.Doc({ guid: id })`). Taking a separate `workspaceId` parameter
 * would invite drift between the two. `deriveWorkspaceKey` uses the id as an
 * HKDF domain-separation label: it doesn't care whether the string is the
 * guid or an explicit id, only that the two agree.
