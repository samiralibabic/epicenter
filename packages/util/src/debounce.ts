 * Trailing-edge debounce.

 * Wrap `fn` so it runs only after `ms` have elapsed since the most recent
 * call. Each call restarts the timer, and the last call's arguments win.
 * The wrapper returns `void`: a debounced call has no result to await,
 * even when `fn` is async (the returned promise is left to settle on its
 * own, exactly as a bare `setTimeout` callback would be).
 *
 * Call `.cancel()` to drop a pending run without firing it, e.g. from a
 * `[Symbol.dispose]` or other teardown path.
