# Unified Encrypted Workspace Auth

**Date**: 2026-03-27
**Status**: Superseded
**Author**: Codex

**Superseded on 2026-05-07**: The product direction landed, but the public API
described here did not remain the active shape. All authenticated workspace
apps now use encrypted workspace state, including Zhongwen, but current
`origin/main` routes that through `@epicenter/auth`,
`@epicenter/auth-svelte`, `createSession`, and
`attachEncryption(ydoc, { encryptionKeys })` instead of one shared
`packages/svelte-utils` auth constructor.

## Overview

Collapse the remaining split between plain auth and workspace auth. All authenticated apps should use encrypted workspaces, and the shared Svelte auth module should expose one high-level constructor that always coordinates session state with workspace unlock and local-data clearing.

## Motivation

### Current State

The repo still has two product shapes.

Shared auth assumes workspace-coupled encryption:

```ts
export function createWorkspaceAuth({
	baseURL,
	token,
	user,
	workspace,
	signInWithGoogle,
}: {
	baseURL: string | (() => string);
	token: SessionFieldState<string | null>;
	user: SessionFieldState<StoredUser | null>;
	workspace: WorkspaceAuthHandle;
	signInWithGoogle?: (...args: never[]) => Promise<unknown>;
}): WorkspaceAuth;
```

Zhongwen still runs its own plain auth controller and a non-encrypted workspace:

```ts
export const workspace = createWorkspace(definition)
	.withExtension('persistence', indexeddbPersistence)
	.withExtension('broadcast', broadcastChannelSync);
```

```ts
function createAuth() {
	let pendingAction = $state<PendingAction>('bootstrapping');
	// separate status machine, refresh flow, fetch wrapper, Google flow
}
```

This creates problems:

1. **Duplicated auth flow**: Zhongwen owns its own phase machine, Better Auth client wiring, redirect handling, and refresh semantics.
2. **Two meanings of sign-out**: workspace apps clear local encrypted data on sign-out; Zhongwen currently keeps local IndexedDB data outside auth.
3. **API drift pressure**: any future auth fix must be made in both the shared controller and Zhongwen's fork.
4. **Soft product invariant**: the repo already treats authenticated workspace apps as encrypted-by-default, but the API still makes that read like an optional variant.

### Desired State

All authenticated apps use the same top-level API:

```ts
export const authState = createAuth({
	baseURL: APP_URLS.API,
	token,
	user,
	workspace,
});
```

The workspace remains the low-level owner of encryption mechanics:

```ts
export const workspace = createWorkspace(definition)
	.withEncryption({ userKeyCache })
	.withExtension('persistence', indexeddbPersistence)
	.withExtension('broadcast', broadcastChannelSync);
```

The auth layer owns session lifecycle and calls into the workspace to unlock, try unlock, and clear local data.

## Research Findings

### What the current code actually separates

The shared auth controller already owns the real cross-app behavior:

| Concern | Shared auth | Zhongwen local auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bootstrap state machine | Yes | Yes |
| Better Auth token issuance handling | Yes | Yes |
| Auth-aware `fetch` | Yes | Yes |
| Session refresh semantics | Yes | Yes |
| Google redirect interruption handling | Yes | Yes |
| Workspace unlock on authenticated session | Yes | No |
| Local-data clear on sign-out | Yes | No |
| External session watch for extension storage | Yes | No |

Key finding: the duplication is not around app-specific UI. It is the auth controller itself.

Implication: we should remove the plain-auth fork, not keep polishing two controllers.

### What encryption changes in practice

Workspace encryption is not just "store bytes encrypted." The current library contract is:

```ts
workspace.encryption.unlock(userKey)
workspace.encryption.tryUnlock()
workspace.encryption.lock()
workspace.clearLocalData()
```

`clearLocalData()` locks first, wipes persistence, and clears the configured user-key cache. `tryUnlock()` only exists when a `userKeyCache` is configured.

Key finding: the runtime overhead is small, but the lifecycle semantics are not. Encryption changes startup, sign-out, and what local persistence means.

Implication: if we force encryption everywhere, Zhongwen's local chat data becomes auth-owned local data by design.

### Existing server contract

The API already returns `encryptionKey` in custom session fields:

```ts
customSession(async ({ user, session }) => {
	const encryptionKey = await deriveUserKey(currentKey.secret, user.id);
	return {
		user,
		session,
		encryptionKey: bytesToBase64(encryptionKey),
		keyVersion: currentKey.version,
	};
})
```

Key finding: the server already emits the root key material needed to unlock every authenticated workspace.

Implication: we do not need a new auth protocol to make Zhongwen encrypted.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| High-level auth API | One public `createAuth(...)` constructor | Matches the new product invariant: authenticated apps are encrypted workspace apps |
| Workspace requirement | `workspace` is required | Auth now always coordinates unlock and sign-out data clearing |
| Workspace API ownership | Keep encryption mechanics in `@epicenter/workspace` | Prevents the Svelte auth layer from becoming the crypto abstraction layer |
| Startup contract | Add `whenReady` and keep `refreshSession()` | `whenReady` matches how apps already use `bootstrap()` as a render gate |
| Manual subscription API | Remove `subscribe()` if no implementation dependency remains | Repo callsites read reactive getters directly; manual listener plumbing is dead weight |
| Zhongwen persistence | Encrypt workspace and add a user-key cache | Preserves local-first startup instead of forcing a network roundtrip before unlock |
| External session sync | Keep optional `watch` on session fields | Chrome extension storage has real cross-context session changes |

## Architecture

The target layering is:

Startup flow:

```text
STEP 1: local field readiness
─────────────────────────────
Await token.whenReady and user.whenReady if present.

STEP 2: local workspace unlock
──────────────────────────────
If a cached user exists and the workspace supports tryUnlock(), attempt unlock from the cached user key.

STEP 3: first render
────────────────────
Resolve auth.whenReady so the app can render against local session state.

STEP 4: server session refresh
──────────────────────────────
Call refreshSession() to validate the token and apply the latest user + encryption key from the API.
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Shared auth API cleanup

- [x] **1.1** Rename the shared public constructor to `createAuth(...)` and keep the workspace requirement.
- [x] **1.2** Add `whenReady` to the returned auth object and switch the internal bootstrap promise to back that property.
- [x] **1.3** Remove the unused manual subscription API if no implementation dependency remains after the refactor.
- [x] **1.4** Keep the session-field seam minimal: `current`, optional `set`, optional `whenReady`, optional `watch`.

### Phase 2: Zhongwen migration

- [x] **2.1** Update Zhongwen's workspace client to use `.withEncryption({ userKeyCache })`.
- [x] **2.2** Add a Zhongwen user-key cache implementation for local-first unlock.
- [x] **2.3** Replace Zhongwen's local auth controller with the shared `createAuth(...)` call.
- [x] **2.4** Verify Zhongwen still boots from local state and still refreshes server auth on mount.

### Phase 3: Shared callsite migration

- [x] **3.1** Migrate Honeycrisp, Opensidian, and tab-manager imports to the renamed shared constructor.
- [x] **3.2** Keep tab-manager's custom Google flow and chrome storage behavior unchanged.
- [ ] **3.3** Update any docs or comments that still describe auth as two product shapes.

### Phase 4: Verification

- [ ] **4.1** Typecheck the touched packages and apps.
- [x] **4.2** Smoke test route-level render gates that currently use `bootstrap()`.
- [ ] **4.3** Confirm sign-out still clears local data for encrypted workspaces.

## Edge Cases

### Cached auth without cached user key

1. Token and user restore from persisted session fields.
2. Workspace has encryption enabled but no cached user key.
3. `whenReady` resolves from local auth fields, but local workspace data stays locked until `refreshSession()` succeeds.

Expected outcome: avoid this state for Zhongwen by configuring a user-key cache.

### External sign-out in the extension

1. Another extension context clears token/user.
2. `watch` fires in the active context.
3. Auth state goes signed-out and `workspace.clearLocalData()` runs.

Expected outcome: keep the existing watch-based behavior in tab-manager.

## Open Questions

1. **Should `bootstrap()` survive as an alias to `whenReady`, or should we force all callsites to move immediately?**
   - Options: (a) keep both temporarily, (b) replace with `whenReady` everywhere now
   - **Recommendation**: keep both for one pass if it lowers migration risk, then remove `bootstrap()` once all callsites have moved.

2. **Should `createAuth(...)` return `error` or keep `signInError`?**
   - `signInError` is inherited from the current UI contract, but the error now also covers refresh failures and external sign-out cleanup failures.
   - **Recommendation**: keep `signInError` for this pass to minimize churn; rename later only if the UI wants the broader meaning.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All authenticated apps use encrypted workspaces.
- [ ] Zhongwen no longer owns a local auth controller.
- [ ] The shared auth module exposes one main public constructor for app auth.
- [ ] Route-level startup uses `whenReady` or a compatibility alias backed by the same promise.
- [ ] Sign-out still clears local encrypted data across apps.

The checklist is intentionally left as historical state. Some goals landed,
but not through the exact API in this spec. Marking every item complete would
hide the fact that the implementation moved to a different boundary.

## Review

Implemented two cleanup passes of the unified encrypted-workspace auth rollout.

What changed:

- Added `createAuth(...)` as the main shared constructor in `packages/svelte-utils/src/auth.svelte.ts`.
- Added `whenReady` to the auth return shape while keeping `bootstrap()` as a compatibility alias for now.
- Migrated Honeycrisp, Opensidian, Zhongwen, and tab-manager to import `createAuth(...)`.
- Updated route-level render gates to read `authState.whenReady`.
- Switched Zhongwen's workspace to `.withEncryption({ userKeyCache })`.
- Added a Zhongwen browser `userKeyCache` implementation backed by `sessionStorage`.
- Removed the unused manual `subscribe()` path from shared auth.
- Removed the `createWorkspaceAuth` compatibility alias and the old `WorkspaceAuth*` compatibility types.
- Removed the `bootstrap()` compatibility method after migrating the route-level callsites.

Verification notes:

- `git diff --check` passed for the touched files.
- Repo-wide `bun run typecheck` / `bun run check` still fail because of many pre-existing errors in `packages/workspace`, `packages/ui`, and unrelated app files.
- Targeted greps over the typecheck output did not surface new diagnostics in the touched auth files.

Remaining follow-up:

- Do a runtime sign-out sanity pass to confirm `workspace.clearLocalData()` still behaves as expected in Zhongwen.

### Supersession Notes

The important outcome from this spec is now true: Zhongwen is no longer a
plain-auth exception, and authenticated apps construct encrypted signed-in
workspace state. The mechanism changed:

```text
Old target in this spec
  createAuth({ baseURL, token, user, workspace })
    -> workspace unlock / clear local data

Current origin/main
  createCookieAuth(...) / createBearerAuth(...)
    -> createSession({ auth, build })
    -> open app workspace with encryptionKeys getter
    -> attachEncryption(ydoc, { encryptionKeys })
```

The old follow-up about `workspace.clearLocalData()` should be translated
before execution. In current code, review disposal, reload-on-user-change, and
encrypted IndexedDB lifecycle rather than looking for that exact method.
