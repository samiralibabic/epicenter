# Spec Execution

When handed a specification document (a `specs/*.md` file), execute it methodically in waves. A wave is an implementation checkpoint: after it lands, the repo should build, relevant tests should pass, and the spec should describe what is now true.

Commits should follow the shape of the work. Commit after a wave when that wave is a natural review unit. Combine waves into one larger commit when the changes are tightly coupled. Break a large wave into smaller commits when that makes the history easier to audit. The goal is working checkpoints first, readable git history second.

## When to Apply This Skill

Use this pattern when you need to:

- Implement a `specs/*.md` plan end-to-end in structured waves.
- Decide which spec tasks run in parallel vs sequentially.
- Update spec checkboxes and implementation notes after each wave.
- Commit code changes together with spec progress at sensible review boundaries.
- Finish execution by running `post-implementation-review`, setting spec status, and adding a review section.

## The Execution Loop

```
READ SPEC
    ↓
PLAN WAVES (which tasks are parallel vs sequential?)
    ↓
┌─── WAVE N ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Execute tasks (sub-agents when useful)       │
│  2. Verify (type-check, tests if applicable)     │
│  3. Update spec (check off items, add notes)     │
│  4. Commit or checkpoint, based on review shape  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
REPEAT until spec is complete
    ↓
FINAL REVIEW (run post-implementation-review, update spec status, add review section)
```

## Phase 1: Read and Understand

Before touching any code:

1. **Read the entire spec**: understand the full scope before planning
2. **Identify the implementation phases** from the spec's Implementation Plan section
3. **Map dependencies**: which tasks block others? Which are independent?
4. **Check the spec's Open Questions**: resolve what you can, flag what needs human input

If the spec has unresolved Open Questions that block implementation, surface them immediately. Don't guess on architectural decisions.

## Phase 2: Plan Waves

Break the spec's implementation plan into execution waves. A wave is a set of changes that can land together while leaving the repo working.

Breaking API changes are allowed inside a wave. The boundary matters: by the end of the wave, update affected consumers, migrations, tests, or documentation so the repo is coherent again.

### Deciding Parallel vs Sequential

Use sub-agents whenever the runtime permits and the task can be scoped cleanly. The question is whether each task is small, bounded, and non-overlapping enough to delegate safely, and whether delegated tasks should run concurrently or sequentially.

| Condition | Ordering |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks touch different files/modules | Parallel |
| Task B imports from Task A's output | Sequential (A before B) |
| Tasks modify the same file | Sequential (avoid conflicts) |
| Tasks are in different spec phases | Sequential (phase order) |
| Tasks within a phase are independent | Parallel |

### Wave Planning Checklist

Before executing, write out your wave plan:

```
Wave 1: [Foundation, types and interfaces]
  - Task 1.1 (parallel with 1.2)
  - Task 1.2 (parallel with 1.1)
  - Checkpoint: verify and update spec
  - Commit: optional, if this is a reviewable unit

Wave 2: [Core logic, depends on Wave 1 types]
  - Task 2.1 (sequential, modifies shared module)
  - Task 2.2 (after 2.1, uses its exports)
  - Checkpoint: verify and update spec
  - Commit: likely, because this changes behavior

Wave 3: [Integration, consumers of Wave 2]
  - Task 3.1 (parallel with 3.2)
  - Task 3.2 (parallel with 3.1)
  - Checkpoint: verify and update spec
  - Commit: combine with Wave 2 if the API and consumers should be reviewed together
```

Proceed after planning unless the spec has unresolved product choices, architecture choices, destructive actions, broad scope risk, or conflicts with current code. Surface those blockers and pause for user input.

## Phase 3: Execute Waves

For each wave:

### 1. Execute Tasks

Use sub-agents for scoped implementation work when they are available. They are strongest when each agent owns a bounded task, a clear file set, and a non-overlapping write surface. The primary agent still owns orchestration, integration, verification, spec updates, and final review.

- **Independent tasks**: Launch sub-agents in parallel when write sets do not overlap. Each gets a focused prompt with only the context it needs: the relevant spec section, the files to modify, and the patterns to follow.
- **Dependent tasks**: Launch sub-agents sequentially when one task imports from another task's output or modifies the same files. Wait for one to complete before launching the next. The second agent gets the output/context from the first.
- **Local tasks**: Keep work local when the task is tightly coupled, urgent, too ambiguous to delegate, or likely to block the next orchestration step.
- **Keep changes minimal**: Each task should do exactly what the spec says. No bonus refactors, no "while I'm here" improvements.

### 2. Verify the Wave

After all tasks in a wave complete:

```bash
bun typecheck                 # repo-standard type-check
bun test                       # if tests exist for changed code
```

If verification fails, fix issues before proceeding. Don't carry broken state into the next wave.

### 3. Update the Spec

Check off completed items in the spec's Implementation Plan:

```markdown
- [x] **1.1** Add IconDefinition type
- [x] **1.2** Add CoverDefinition type
- [ ] **2.1** Update factory functions
```

If implementation deviated from the spec (it often does), add a note:

```markdown
- [x] **1.1** Add IconDefinition type
  > **Note**: Used discriminated union instead of enum as originally planned.
  > Rationale: better type narrowing in consumers.
```

If you discovered something during implementation, add it to the spec's Research Findings or Edge Cases section.

### 4. Commit or Checkpoint the Wave

Each committed unit should include BOTH the code changes AND the spec updates that describe those changes. This keeps history honest: each commit shows what was planned, what changed, and what was actually built.

You do not have to create one commit per wave. Use the commit shape that best fits the review:

| Situation | Commit Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Wave is a self-contained foundation or behavior change | Commit the wave |
| Several waves are tightly coupled and make sense only together | Combine them into one larger commit |
| One wave contains multiple independently reviewable changes | Split it into logical commits |
| The user wants one large commit | Keep intermediate working checkpoints, then create one final commit |

Follow `git` and `incremental-commits` skill conventions:

```
feat(scope): wave description, what this wave accomplishes

- Completed spec items 1.1, 1.2
- [Any notable deviations or discoveries]
```

Stage specific files. Never `git add .` or `git add -A`.

## Phase 4: Final Review

After all waves complete:

1. **Run `post-implementation-review`** against the files touched by the spec.
   Use the findings to clean up stale abstractions, dead paths, invariant drift,
   naming issues, and missing verification before handoff.
2. **Update spec status** from "In Progress" to "Implemented"
3. **Add a Review section** at the bottom of the spec:

```markdown
## Review

**Completed**: [Date]
**Branch**: [branch-name]

### Summary

[2-3 sentences on what was built and how it differs from the original plan]

### Deviations from Spec

- [What changed and why]

### Follow-up Work

- [Anything discovered during implementation that should be a future spec]
```

4. **Final commit or final amend/squash** with the review section included, matching the commit strategy chosen earlier

## Sub-Agent Prompts

The primary agent orchestrates: it plans waves, launches sub-agents when useful, verifies results, updates the spec, and commits. It may implement tightly coupled or blocking work directly when delegation would add coordination cost or risk.

When spinning up sub-agents, each agent needs:

- **The specific spec section** it's implementing (not the whole spec)
- **The files it should read** before making changes
- **The files it should modify** (and only those files)
- **The patterns to follow** (reference relevant skills)
- **What NOT to do**: stay in lane, don't touch other files

Keep sub-agent prompts focused. A sub-agent that knows too much will try to do too much.

## When Things Go Wrong

| Situation | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Type-check fails after a wave | Fix before moving on. Don't carry broken state. |
| Sub-agent made changes outside its scope | Revert the out-of-scope changes. Keep only what was asked for. |
| Spec item is ambiguous mid-implementation | Stop. Ask the user. Add clarification to the spec. |
| Discovery invalidates a later spec phase | Update the spec's plan. Inform the user. Re-plan remaining waves. |
| Tests fail | Fix the tests or the code. Update spec if the test failure reveals a spec gap. |

## Anti-Patterns

### Execute Without Planning

```
"Let me just start implementing..."
```

No. Read the spec, plan waves, then execute. Pause only for unresolved product choices, architecture choices, destructive actions, broad scope risk, or conflicts with current code.

### Giant Wave

```
Wave 1: Implement everything in the spec
```

If a wave touches more than 5-8 files, ask whether it still represents one coherent working checkpoint. Sometimes a broad breaking change needs to happen together, but default to smaller waves when reviewability or verification would improve.

### Spec Drift

```
Code diverges from spec but spec is never updated
```

The spec is a living document. Every commit should leave the spec accurate to what was actually built.

### Over-Parallel

```
Wave 1: 12 sub-agents all running at once
```

More than 3-4 parallel sub-agents gets chaotic. Group related tasks and keep parallelism manageable.

## Quick Reference

Before starting:

- [ ] Read entire spec
- [ ] Identify phases and dependencies
- [ ] Plan waves (parallel vs sequential)
- [ ] Surface blockers that need user input

For each wave:

- [ ] Execute tasks (sub-agents when useful)
- [ ] Verify (type-check, tests)
- [ ] Update spec (check items, add notes)
- [ ] Commit if this wave is a logical review unit, or checkpoint and continue

After all waves:

- [ ] Run `post-implementation-review` on touched files
- [ ] Update spec status to Implemented
- [ ] Add Review section
- [ ] Finalize commits using the chosen strategy
