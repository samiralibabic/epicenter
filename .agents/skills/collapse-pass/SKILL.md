# Collapse Pass

A collapse pass is a session-long sequence of small commits that each delete one piece of indirection. Every commit must shrink the public surface, the file count, the call-graph depth, or the first-read effort. If a commit moves none of those needles, revert it and find a deeper smell.

> **Related skills**: [code-audit](../code-audit/SKILL.md) lists the codebase-specific smell categories with grep patterns. [refactoring](../refactoring/SKILL.md) owns the per-change mechanics (caller counting, inlining, surgical commits). [one-sentence-test](../one-sentence-test/SKILL.md) is the cohesion gate for each candidate file. [cohesive-clean-breaks](../cohesive-clean-breaks/SKILL.md) covers the deeper redesigns when a collapse won't fit in one commit. [approachability-audit](../approachability-audit/SKILL.md) checks the diff from a stranger's perspective. [post-implementation-review](../post-implementation-review/SKILL.md) is the second-read protocol after each commit.

## References

Load on demand:

- Before any edit, read [references/never-touch.md](references/never-touch.md). It names the durable strings, schemas, and shapes you must not change without surfacing first, plus the pause list.
- For the grep cookbook with calibrated patterns, read [references/smell-catalog.md](references/smell-catalog.md).
- For the operating principle that decides hard cases, read [references/library-refusal.md](references/library-refusal.md).
- For the per-checkpoint surface format and the stop-time final report shape, read [references/report-format.md](references/report-format.md).
- For a thin `/goal` template that invokes this skill, read [references/goal-template.md](references/goal-template.md).
- For Epicenter's repeatable monorepo maintenance pass, read [references/periodic-monorepo-pass.md](references/periodic-monorepo-pass.md).

## Operating principle

When a library refuses your model, treat the refusal as information about the model, not as friction to route around. If a "simplification" requires reimplementing a library's public surface, stop and delete the model instead.

## Per-iteration ritual

For each candidate file or symbol family:

1. **Pick one target.** Count non-test callers exactly with `rg`. If zero, the candidate is a dead-export collapse. If one, it's an inline-the-helper collapse. If many, find a narrower target.
2. **Mentally inline** every helper, wrapper, prop, and indirection layer into its callers. Read the inlined result as a stranger would.
3. **Run the one-sentence test** on the file. Write one concrete sentence describing what it does today. If the sentence drifts or grows "or" clauses, name the ambiguity; that ambiguity is usually the smell.
4. **Surface the finding BEFORE editing**, in this exact shape:

   ```
   Finding N: <smell>
   Inline check: <what mental inlining showed>
   Fix: <proposed change>
   What stays the same: <visible behavior, durable strings, blob layout>
   ```

5. **Apply mechanical, low-risk findings only.** For each:
   - `bun test` on impacted packages
   - `bun run typecheck` on impacted packages
   - One conventional-commit per logical simplification, citing `file:line` and naming what collapsed
6. **Re-grep the removed/renamed symbol.** Sweep stragglers (stale JSDoc, dead re-exports, orphaned imports) in a follow-up `chore: straggler sweep` commit.
7. **Move to the next file.**

## The anti-cosmetic gate

After each commit, at least one must be true:

- Public API surface shrank (one fewer exported name)
- File count shrank (single-function file folded into its caller)
- Call-graph depth shrank (one indirection layer removed)
- A future first-read got measurably easier

If none is true, the change was cosmetic. Revert and find a deeper smell.

## Pause and surface to the user

Stop and ask before:

- Changing any string from `references/never-touch.md`
- Deleting a public exported name with zero in-repo callers but plausible external CLI/SDK consumers
- Collapsing two files where one's JSDoc documents a non-obvious invariant
- Merging packages or moving exports across package boundaries
- Changing a function signature that crosses a published package boundary

## Stop conditions

Stop when any of the following is true:

- Three consecutive files yield no findings
- Remaining findings all require product input (renaming a public capability, splitting a package, adding a tenant axis)
- A typecheck or test regression cannot be resolved in one follow-up commit
- A configured checkpoint budget is reached (e.g. 8 checkpoints)

At stop, deliver the final report from [references/report-format.md](references/report-format.md).

## Pass parameters worth declaring

A goal that invokes this skill should say:

- **Scope**: which packages and which apps
- **Stop condition**: "three no-finding files" or "N checkpoints" or "queue empty"
- **Citation requirement**: whether library refusals must be backed by a deepwiki citation against the upstream repo
- **Starting target**: usually the narrowest surface first (e.g. `packages/auth` before `apps/api`)

Everything else (the ritual, gate, finding format, never-touch list, report shape) is in this skill.
