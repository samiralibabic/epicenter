# Svelte Mutations And Workspace Inputs

Detailed Svelte guidance for TanStack Query mutation placement, inline template actions, and commit-on-blur workspace field editing.

# Mutation Patterns

## In Svelte Files (.svelte)

Always prefer `createMutation` from TanStack Query for mutations. This provides:

- Loading states (`isPending`)
- Error states (`isError`)
- Success states (`isSuccess`)
- Better UX with automatic state management

### The Preferred Pattern

Pass `onSuccess` and `onError` as the second argument to `.mutate()` to get maximum context:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { createMutation } from '@tanstack/svelte-query';
	import * as rpc from '$lib/query';

	// Wrap .options in accessor function, no parentheses on .options
	// Name it after what it does, NOT with a "Mutation" suffix (redundant)
	const deleteSession = createMutation(
		() => rpc.sessions.deleteSession.options,
	);

	// Local state that we can access in callbacks
	let isDialogOpen = $state(false);
</script>

<Button
	onclick={() => {
		// Pass callbacks as second argument to .mutate()
		deleteSession.mutate(
			{ sessionId },
			{
				onSuccess: () => {
					// Access local state and context
					isDialogOpen = false;
					toast.success('Session deleted');
					goto('/sessions');
				},
				onError: (error) => {
					toast.error(error.title, { description: error.description });
				},
			},
		);
	}}
	disabled={deleteSession.isPending}
>
	{#if deleteSession.isPending}
		Deleting...
	{:else}
		Delete
	{/if}
</Button>
```

### Why This Pattern?

- **More context**: Access to local variables and state at the call site
- **Better organization**: Success/error handling is co-located with the action
- **Flexibility**: Different calls can have different success/error behaviors

## In TypeScript Files (.ts)

Always use `.execute()` since createMutation requires component context:

```typescript
// In a .ts file (e.g., load function, utility)
const result = await rpc.sessions.createSession.execute({
	body: { title: 'New Session' },
});

const { data, error } = result;
if (error) {
	// Handle error
} else if (data) {
	// Handle success
}
```

## Exception: When to Use .execute() in Svelte Files

Only use `.execute()` in Svelte files when:

1. You don't need loading states
2. You're performing a one-off operation
3. You need fine-grained control over async flow

## Single-Use Functions: Inline or Document

If a function is defined in the script tag and used only once in the template, inline it at the call site. This applies to event handlers, callbacks, and any other single-use logic.

### Why Inline?

Single-use extracted functions add indirection: the reader jumps between the function definition and the template to understand what happens on click/keydown/etc. Inlining keeps cause and effect together at the point where the action happens.

```svelte
<!-- BAD: Extracted single-use function with no JSDoc or semantic value -->
<script>
	function handleShare() {
		share.mutate({ id });
	}

	function handleSelectItem(itemId: string) {
		goto(`/items/${itemId}`);
	}
</script>

<Button onclick={handleShare}>Share</Button>
<Item onclick={() => handleSelectItem(item.id)} />

<!-- GOOD: Inlined at the call site -->
<Button onclick={() => share.mutate({ id })}>Share</Button>
<Item onclick={() => goto(`/items/${item.id}`)} />
```

This also applies to longer handlers. If the logic is linear (guard clauses + branches, not deeply nested), inline it even if it's 10-15 lines:

```svelte
<!-- GOOD: Inlined keyboard shortcut handler -->
<svelte:window onkeydown={(e) => {
	const meta = e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey;
	if (!meta) return;
	if (e.key === 'k') {
		e.preventDefault();
		commandPaletteOpen = !commandPaletteOpen;
		return;
	}
	if (e.key === 'n') {
		e.preventDefault();
		notesState.createNote();
	}
}} />
```

### The Exception: JSDoc + Semantic Name

Keep a single-use function extracted **only** when both conditions are met:

1. It has **JSDoc** explaining why it exists as a named unit.
2. The name provides a **clear semantic meaning** that makes the template more readable than the inlined version would be.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	/**
	 * Navigate the note list with arrow keys, wrapping at boundaries.
	 * Operates on the flattened display-order ID list to respect date grouping.
	 */
	function navigateWithArrowKeys(e: KeyboardEvent) {
		// 15 lines of keyboard navigation logic...
	}
</script>

<!-- The semantic name communicates intent better than inlined logic would -->
<div onkeydown={navigateWithArrowKeys} tabindex="-1">
```

Without JSDoc and a meaningful name, extract it anyway: the indirection isn't earning its keep.

### Multi-Use Functions

Functions used **2 or more times** should always stay extracted: this rule only applies to single-use functions.

# Commit-on-Blur for Workspace String Fields

For plain string fields backed by a workspace table or Y.Map row (title, subtitle, name, description, license, label), **commit on `onblur`, not `oninput`**. Per-keystroke writes turn one typing session into N Yjs transactions, N IDB writes, N sync messages, and N BroadcastChannel posts. Commit-on-blur collapses that to one.

The pattern has two halves: the **per-input handler** and the **app-wide safety net**. Both are required: the safety net is what makes commit-on-blur survive Cmd+W mid-edit.

## The handler

```svelte
<input
  type="text"
  value={entry.title}
  onblur={(e) => {
    const next = e.currentTarget.value;
    if (next !== entry.title) updateEntry({ title: next });
  }}
/>
```

The compare-then-write guard avoids a no-op Yjs transaction when focus passes through an unchanged field. For factories that update many fields, extract a small `commit(field, next)` helper that does the compare internally.

## The safety net (app-wide, in `+layout.svelte`)

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  function flushPendingEdits() {
    if (
      document.visibilityState === 'hidden' &&
      document.activeElement instanceof HTMLElement
    ) {
      document.activeElement.blur();
    }
  }
</script>

<svelte:document onvisibilitychange={flushPendingEdits} />
<svelte:window onpagehide={flushPendingEdits} />
```

When the page is being hidden (tab close, Cmd+W, tab switch, window minimize, iOS app-switch, bfcache), `.blur()` on the focused element synchronously dispatches its blur event, which synchronously runs your commit handler, which synchronously updates the Y.Doc: all before the page tears down. Six lines, one place, every `<input onblur>` in the app inherits the resilience.

`visibilitychange` is a document event, `pagehide` is a window event. Per Svelte's `packages/svelte/elements.d.ts`, `onvisibilitychange` lives on `SvelteDocumentAttributes` and `onpagehide` lives on `SvelteWindowAttributes`: keep them on the right element. Listen to both: visibilitychange is more reliable on iOS Safari, pagehide catches bfcache navigations.

## The default for new apps

Every new app under `apps/*` should ship the safety net in `+layout.svelte` as part of scaffolding. Treat it like `<Toaster />` or `<ModeWatcher />`: a layout-level concern that's free once installed. See `workspace-app-layout` for where this fits in the `+layout.svelte` checklist.

## When NOT to use commit-on-blur

| Field type | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Plain string Y.Map field (title, subtitle, name, description, license) | **commit-on-blur** |
| Y.Text bound through y-prosemirror / y-codemirror / tiptap | per-keystroke (CRDT operates at character level) |
| Discrete selectors (radio, checkbox, datepicker, tag pickers) | inline event handler: already one event per action |
| Search box / filter that doesn't persist | local `$state` only, no commit |
| Component-local form state submitted on a button click | accumulate in `$state`, commit in the click handler |

For Y.Text fields you specifically want every keystroke to participate in operational transform: commit-on-blur defeats the point of the CRDT.

## Defensive variant: local state + focus flag

If a sibling tab editing the same row could clobber in-progress typing (rare in personal apps), reach for a local-state buffer with a focus flag: but only if the clobber actually shows up:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  let localTitle = $state(entry.title);
  let editing = $state(false);
  $effect(() => { if (!editing) localTitle = entry.title; });
</script>

<input
  bind:value={localTitle}
  onfocus={() => (editing = true)}
  onblur={() => {
    editing = false;
    if (localTitle !== entry.title) commit(localTitle);
  }}
/>
```

For true conflict-free text editing across tabs, switch the field to Y.Text + a CRDT-aware editor binding instead.

See `docs/articles/commit-on-blur-survives-tab-close.md` for the full rationale, persistence-layer reliability table, and the page-lifecycle guarantees behind the safety net.
