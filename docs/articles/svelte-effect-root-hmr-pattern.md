# The `$effect.root` + `import.meta.hot.dispose` Pattern

I hit a weird bug. Logging in, logging out, logging in again — and somewhere around the third cycle the app started calling `workspace.applySession` twice on every token rotation, then three times, then five. No new code, just HMR reloads while I worked.

The fix is one line most Svelte tutorials don't teach you. Here's the pattern and why it's the pattern.

## The setup

Epicenter's Svelte apps bridge auth state to workspace state with a single reactive effect at module scope:

```ts
// apps/fuji/src/lib/client.svelte.ts

const dispose = $effect.root(() => {
  $effect(() => {
    void workspace.applySession(auth.session);
  });
});
if (import.meta.hot) import.meta.hot.dispose(dispose);
```

`auth.session` is a reactive getter on the auth client. When it changes (login, logout, token rotation), the inner `$effect` fires and calls `applySession(next)` on the workspace. One direction, one source of truth, no callback pair reaching across the auth ↔ workspace boundary.

The `$effect` has to run at module scope — it's not inside a component, it's not inside `onMount`, and there's nothing that would "unmount" it naturally. That's what `$effect.root` is for: it creates a reactive scope that lives outside the component tree.

## Why the disposer line matters

Svelte's docs say `$effect.root()` returns a cleanup function. What they don't say loudly enough: **you have to call it on HMR, or the effect graph leaks.**

Here's what happens without the disposer during development:

```
save file → Vite HMR → module re-evaluates
                        ↓
                    new $effect.root() created
                        ↓
                    old $effect.root() still alive — nothing destroyed it
                        ↓
                    auth.session changes
                        ↓
                    BOTH effects fire → applySession called TWICE
```

Save again and it's three roots. Save again, five. The old roots still observe `auth.session` through Svelte's dependency graph, and Svelte has no way to know they're stale — they were created at module scope, not component scope, so the component lifecycle that normally cleans up effects doesn't see them.

`import.meta.hot.dispose(dispose)` tells Vite: *"before replacing this module, call this function."* Vite fires the disposer, `dispose()` tears down the `$effect.root`, and the new module starts with a clean graph.

## What `dispose()` actually does

I was curious how thorough the cleanup was, so I read the Svelte internals ([`packages/svelte/src/internal/client/reactivity/effects.js:494-541`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/main/packages/svelte/src/internal/client/reactivity/effects.js)). The `destroy_effect` function:

1. Destroys all child effects recursively.
2. Removes the effect from its parent's effect chain.
3. Runs any teardown function the effect returned.
4. Unregisters all reactive dependencies.

So calling `dispose()` from `import.meta.hot.dispose` really does tear down the whole graph. The inner `$effect` gets destroyed, its subscriptions to `auth.session` are dropped, and the next HMR starts fresh.

## The symptoms when you skip it

Without the disposer, the leaks are subtle:

- **Duplicate side effects.** `applySession` runs N times where N = number of HMRs since page load.
- **Stale closures.** An old `$effect.root` captured the old `workspace` reference. The new module has a new `workspace`. Now you have effects calling `applySession` on a defunct instance.
- **Memory pressure.** Each root holds references to the reactive graph. Usually invisible until the tab gets sluggish after 20+ saves.

None of these throw. You discover them by noticing that your login flow feels weird, or a network tab shows three identical requests, or a console.log fires a suspicious number of times.

## When to reach for this pattern

Not often. Most reactive state should live inside components where Svelte's lifecycle handles cleanup for you. But some state genuinely wants to be module-scoped:

- Auth ↔ workspace bridges (my case).
- Global singletons that react to stores — a logger that changes verbosity based on a user preference.
- Coordinator effects that span multiple component trees.

The test: *if this effect were inside a component, would every consumer of the module have to mount that component?* If yes, you want module scope.

## The full pattern, for copy-paste

```ts
// some-bridge.svelte.ts

const dispose = $effect.root(() => {
  $effect(() => {
    // reactive logic here
  });

  // optional: return a cleanup function for non-$effect teardown
  return () => {
    // e.g., close a worker, unsubscribe from a non-rune store
  };
});

if (import.meta.hot) import.meta.hot.dispose(dispose);
```

Three requirements, in order:

1. The file must be `.svelte.ts` (or `.svelte.js`) so the compiler processes runes.
2. The `$effect.root()` call must be at module scope, not inside a function that gets called later — otherwise HMR can't associate it with the module being replaced.
3. The `if (import.meta.hot)` guard is necessary because `import.meta.hot` is undefined in production builds; calling `.dispose` on it would throw.

Skip any of these and the bug comes back. Miss the guard in production, you crash at boot. Put the root inside a function, HMR leaks silently. Use a plain `.ts` extension, Svelte's compiler ignores the runes and `$effect.root` is just an error.

## What the Svelte docs leave out

The canonical docs mention `$effect.root` as *"useful for nested effects that you want to manually control"* and gesture at the cleanup function. What I wanted — and didn't find until I read the compiler source — was a clear statement that module-scoped roots need explicit HMR disposers, and that Vite's `import.meta.hot.dispose` is the exact hook to pair them with.

So: this post. If you're reading it because your `applySession` fires N times after a few saves, that's why, and that's the fix.
