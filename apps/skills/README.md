# Skills Editor

A local editor for writing the prompt files and configuration that power Epicenter agents. It uses Yjs CRDTs under the hood, so undo and redo work across sessions and the format is ready for collaboration, but it does not sync anywhere. Your skills stay on your machine.

Part of the [Epicenter](https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter) monorepo. MIT licensed.

## How it works

### What's a skill?

A skill is a set of instructions (markdown) plus reference files that tell an Epicenter agent how to perform a specific task. Each skill has metadata (name, description, license, compatibility) and one or more reference documents. The Skills Editor is where you author and organize these.

### Workspace connection

The app composes its browser workspace in `src/lib/skills/browser.ts`.
`src/lib/skills/client.ts` exports the running `skills` singleton for Svelte
components. `@epicenter/skills` provides the pure `openSkills()` factory,
document builders, guid helpers, and action factory; the app owns IndexedDB,
BroadcastChannel, and inline `createDisposableCache` sources for
instructions and references. The workspace ID is `epicenter.skills`. No remote
sync is wired in, so the editor works entirely offline.

### Collaborative editing

Each skill's instructions and each reference's content are `Y.Doc`-backed documents. CodeMirror 6 with `y-codemirror.next` binds directly to those documents, so edits are conflict-free and survive concurrent sessions.

### UI

A single route renders a resizable split view: sidebar on the left, editor panel on the right.

- **Sidebar**: skill list with search, keyboard navigation (arrow keys), inline rename (F2), and delete with confirmation.
- **Editor panel**: metadata form (name, description, license, compatibility), instructions editor (CodeMirror + Yjs), and a references panel with expandable entries, each with its own CodeMirror editor.
- **Command palette**: search across skills from anywhere.
